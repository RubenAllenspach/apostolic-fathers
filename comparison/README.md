`{}_ORIG.txt` is the result of `merge.py` after some cleanup (see `NOTES.txt`)

This `{}_ORIG.txt` is always what's given to Seumas.

It is then copied to `{}_JT1.txt` and the middle column (only) is edited.

Seumas's first correction is saved to `{}_SM1.txt`.

If the correction is to something other than what Lake has in the scan, we mark it with an asterisk (if certain). We use a question mark if it might need to be corrected but we're not sure.

`{}_JT1vsSM1.txt` is the comparison of `JT1` and `SM1`.

`{}_JT2.txt` and `{}_SM2.txt` are the second pass and are usually identical but sometimes a third pass was necessary, in which case `{}_JT2vsSM2.txt` is the comparison of `JT2` and `SM2`.

In the case of Hermas, I captured some addition `_notes.txt`.
