JT: The text clearly has μενανοίας. Is there ANY reason to think this isn't supposed to be μετανοίας?
SM: I can't think of a reason not to correct to μετανοίας

3.6.1   3413 ac   πονηρίας*                 πονηρίας
JT: The only reason I added a * is in the printed text I looked at, the acute seems to (incorrectly) be a rough breathing.
SM: I can concede that it might be a rough breathing misprint; retain the * as you please

3.7.6   3915 ab   βασανισθῶσιν*             βασανισθωσιν?
JT: Not accented in my printed text so circumflex is supplied.
SM: I just wasn't sure how it should be accented myself, hence ?

JT: Seumas is correct.

3.8.5   4094 bc   εἰσίν?                    εἰσίν
JT: There is a mark in my printed text that looks like it could have been punctuation. But does that make sense?
SM: it looks to me as if there's a comma that hasn't printed, e.g. the ink hasn't come through but the impression is there. But I can see that a period might be better.

9.1.9   7467 ac   ἀμαρτίας                  ἁμαρτίας*
JT: Why the *? Looks fine in my scan.
SM: my scan definitely had a typo.

9.3.7   7936 bc   αὐτῷ·                     αὐτῷ
JT: My scan definitely has middle dot and it makes sense, doesn't it?
SM: my scan definitely didn't have a middle dot, though I can see why one might have one.

JT: Is the * just because of the supplied period?
SM: Aren't these different characters for the numeral?
JT: My printed has stigma and that's what we correct to so not sure need for *

JT: Seumas is correct.

25.2.2  19220 ac   ῥάβδους                   ῥάβδους*
JT: Yes, this should have * as extra accent removed.
SM: right, accent removed.

25.3.2  19589 ac   ἐστι                      ἐστι*
JT: ἐστι is what my scan has. Why the *?
SM: my text is just cut off, but I'm fine with the reading
JT: if we think it's a bad scan rather than a bad printing, we should remove *

25.3.2  19606 ac   κηρύγματος                κηρύγματος*

JT: Looks like a smudged omicron to me, not an alpha, so we'll need a * if it's a correction.
SM: my version seems clearly to be an alpha

JT: Just typographically using a single "ellipsis" character rather than three dots. I believe we did this elsewhere.
SM: Just wasn't sure about typography.
