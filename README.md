# Apostolic Fathers

The Perseus / Open Greek and Latin Project text of Lake is currently being compared with the text in CCEL and in Logos by James Tauber and Seumas Macdonald to produce a corrected text (and eventually) analysis.

See `NOTES.md` for details of the process.

Files in `raw-ccel-lake/` are from <https://www.ccel.org/l/lake/fathers/toc.htm>.

Files in `raw-ogl-lake/` are from <https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit> and <https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/First1KGreek>.

Files in `structured/` put a "verse" on each line with a `chapter.verse` reference (or `book.chapter.verse` reference in the case of The Shepherd of Hermas).

## Status

**Prep** — text converted and aligned  
**JT1** — first correction by James  
**SM1** — first correction by Seumas  
**Done** — consensus achieved and corrected text available
