# Apostolic Fathers

The Perseus / Open Greek and Latin Project text of Lake is currently being compared with the text in CCEL and in Logos by James Tauber and Seumas Macdonald to produce a corrected text (and eventually) analysis of the Apostolic Fathers.

See [NOTES.md](https://github.com/jtauber/apostolic-fathers/blob/master/NOTES.md) for details of the process.

## Status

**Prep** — text converted and aligned  
**JT1** — first correction by James  
**SM1** — first correction by Seumas  
**Done** — consensus achieved and corrected text available
